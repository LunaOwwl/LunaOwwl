- 👋 Hi, I’m @LunaOwwl
- 👀 I am a Software Quality professional, for years and years. I do Python and Robot Framework. Currently between work assignments. When I am not working I’m interested in hiking and singing. Not necessarily always simultaneously, especially when I am hiking with a group of people. When the weather is not supporting outdoorsy activities I play computer games or read.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Development to widen my IT skills portfolio.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Web Design, and Software Quality. 
- 😄 Pronouns: she / her
